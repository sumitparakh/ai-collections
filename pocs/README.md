# Proof of Concepts (POCs)

This directory contains proof-of-concept implementations demonstrating various AI techniques, integrations, and real-world applications.

## Structure

POCs are organized by topic and complexity:

- **llm-workflows/** - Language model workflow demonstrations
- **embeddings/** - Embedding-based applications
- **rag/** - RAG system implementations
- **agents/** - AI agent POCs
- **mcp-servers/** - MCP server implementations
- **automation/** - Real-world automation examples
- **integrations/** - Third-party service integrations

## Language Support

POCs are available in multiple languages:
- 🟨 JavaScript
- 🔷 TypeScript
- 🦀 Rust
- 🐍 Python

Check individual POC directories for language-specific implementations.

## POC Standards

Each POC should include:
- **README.md** - Overview, objectives, and setup instructions
- **Source code** - Well-commented implementation
- **Dependencies** - Package/dependency management files
- **Examples** - Usage examples and sample outputs
- **Notes** - Implementation notes, limitations, and future improvements

## Running POCs

Each POC directory contains specific instructions for:
1. Installing dependencies
2. Configuration requirements
3. Running the POC
4. Expected outputs
5. Testing (if applicable)

## Contributing POCs

When adding a new POC:
1. Create a dedicated directory with a descriptive name
2. Include a comprehensive README
3. Add working, tested code
4. Document any external dependencies or API keys needed
5. Provide example usage
6. Note any limitations or known issues

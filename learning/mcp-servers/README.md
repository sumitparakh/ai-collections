## Topics Covered

- Introduction to MCP
- MCP architecture
- Server implementation
- Client integration
- Tool definitions
- Resource management
- Prompts and templates
- Security considerations
- Testing MCP servers

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources, providing a standardized way to:
- Expose tools and functions
- Share resources and data
- Provide contextual information
- Enable secure integrations

## Server Components

- **Tools** - Functions the LLM can call
- **Resources** - Data and content access
- **Prompts** - Reusable prompt templates
- **Sampling** - LLM request handling

## Examples

- Basic MCP server setup
- Custom tool implementation
- Resource providers
- Client integration
- Production patterns

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of server architecture
- Knowledge of LLM function calling
- Familiarity with API design

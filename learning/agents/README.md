# AI Agents

Learn to build autonomous AI agents that can plan, execute, and adapt to accomplish complex tasks.

## Topics Covered

- Agent architecture and patterns
- Planning and reasoning
- Tool use and function calling
- Memory systems
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Agent orchestration
- Feedback and reflection loops
- Safety and guardrails
- Agent evaluation

## Agent Types
